"""Issue #32: 'theta0' and 'Pol' are ES3-only polarisation keys with no effect
in ElecSus 4, where the input polarisation is the explicit E_in vector.

A p_dict ported from ES3 that still sets them must warn (so the polarisation
angle is not silently dropped), and must not change the computed spectrum.
