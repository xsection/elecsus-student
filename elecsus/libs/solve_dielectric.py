Solve the dielectric tensor for the roots of the complex refractive index by setting determinant to 0

Use analytic solutions for the 'easy' geometries - Faraday (B-field aligned with
wavevector) and Voigt (B-field orthogonal to k-vector).

[ES4 MOD] All other geometries now go through Webber's vectorised analytic
eigen-solution below.  ES3 solved those with SymPy, one detuning point at a
time; that path was removed, and with it this module's SymPy dependency -- the
symbolic derivation it performed is kept as comments in solve_diel() so the
result stays checkable.  Removed alongside it: the development scratch that had
accumulated here (null/nullOld/test_null/test_solveset/main/
calculation_time_analysis/test_equivalence), none of which was reachable from
solve_diel().

	Solves the wave equation to find the two propagating normal modes of the system, 
	for a given magnetic field angle THETA. The Faraday (B along k) and Voigt
	(B perpendicular to k) geometries have closed forms; every other angle goes
	through the vectorised oblique solution further down. ([ES4] ES3 solved the
	oblique case with SymPy, one detuning point at a time.)
	
	Returns the rotation matrix to transform the coordinate system into the normal mode basis,
	and returns the two refractive index arrays.
	
	Inputs:
	
		chiL, chiR, chiZ	:	1D lists or numpy arrays, of length N, that are the frequency-dependent electric susceptibilities
								of the sigma+, sigma- and pi manifolds, as spectra.calc_chi returns them. About B, chiL is
								the susceptibility of the [1,+i]/sqrt2 component and chiR that of [1,-i]/sqrt2.
		THETA				:	Float, Magnetic field angle in radians: B lies along (sin THETA, 0, cos THETA), in the x-z plane
		Bfield				:	Float, Magnitude of applied magnetic field. [ES4 FIX] (issue #97) Unused: below 0.01 G it
								used to select the Faraday solution at any angle but Voigt. Kept for callers' signatures
		
	Options:
		
		verbose			:	Boolean to output more print statements (timing reports mostly)
		force_numeric	:	If True, every angle goes through the oblique solution, even where the Faraday or Voigt form applies
	
	Outputs:
		RotMat	:	Rotation matrix to transform coordinate system, dimensions (3, 3, N)
		n1		:	First solution for refractive index, dimensions (N)
		n2		:	Second solution for refractive index, dimensions (N)
