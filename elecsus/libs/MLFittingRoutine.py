Marquardt-Levenberg fit module

Overhauled October 2016 to use the lmfit module 
(https://lmfit.github.io/lmfit-py/index.html; pip install lmfit; also in the enthought package manager index)
 instead of curve_fit, which makes it much more elegant and easy
 to fit only the selected parameters, and include bounds on parameters

	# [ES4 NEW] BufferGas / BufferPressure / BufferTemp_fill are forwarded to

	# BufferPressure can be a fit parameter; BufferTemp_fill cannot, as the

	# Parameter if it's also passed as a kwarg, which crashes on a non-numeric gas name
